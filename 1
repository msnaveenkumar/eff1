Subject: Effort Analysis for Manual vs. Automated Testing – Weekly Effort Savings

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I have completed the effort calculation comparing manual and automated testing for our current features, based on executing the test scripts once daily over a 5-day workweek. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. Weekly Effort Calculation
Manual Effort (per feature):
= Overall Manual Execution Time (min) x 5 days
Automated Effort (per feature):
= Overall Automation Execution Time (min) x 5 days
2. Data Summary for Each Feature
Feature
Manual Time per Day (min)
Weekly Manual Effort (min)
Automation Time per Day (min)
Weekly Automation Effort (min)
Effort Saved (min) weekly

Total weekly manual effort: 1,320 minutes
Total weekly automation effort: 175 minutes
Total effort saved per week: 1,145 minutes

3. Visualization
You can create a clustered bar chart with the following setup:

X-axis: Features
Y-axis: Effort (Minutes)
Bars:
One representing Weekly Manual Effort
One representing Weekly Automation Effort
This visual will clearly illustrate how automation significantly reduces testing effort—saving approximately 90% of effort on these features.

Please let me know if you'd like the Excel template with the data and chart, or if further analysis is needed.
